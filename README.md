# Serenity Bridge
This is a plugin for the [Serenity JS](https://github.com/SerenityJS/serenity/) server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.
The plugin establishes a connection between a Minecraft and Discord server.

## Getting Started
1) Grab the [latest release](https://github.com/palmmc/serenity-bridge/releases/), and put the `.sjs` file that you download into your `/plugins/` folder.
2) Run your server once, so it loads the plugin.
3) Go into the new folder, then into the `/config/` folder, and make the changes to the configuration files that you want.
4) Set your bot's token and channel ID in `properties.scfg`. (If you do not know how to do this, see the tutorial at the top of the file.)
5) Save your changes, and you're done! Start up your server to begin bridging!

## Feedback
I hope you find good use out of this plugin!
If you have any suggestions, feedback, or bugs, please report them directly to me by joining the [SerenityJS Discord](https://discord.gg/6xBTEZcHHr) and messaging me (**palm1**), or alternatively, create an issue on this github repository.

Happy bridging!
